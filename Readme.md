LearnMakefile

This is a project created to learn the nitty-gritty of Makefile.
The intention is allow developers to understand basics of Makefile.

As Makefile can be very complicated and many developer dread walking this path
including me, let make an humble attempt to get to know the most used rules
and also some features to improve and compile code faster.

The folder are named
1. Basic  - Basic C and CPP source compile
2. Intermediate - Include pre-build libraries and generate library of current source code
3. Advance - Complete embedded project. Yet to decide of the idea
